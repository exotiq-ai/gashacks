2. Click "Sign up" (top right)
3. Choose "GitHub" as your sign-in method

5. Select branch: **`claude/build-polaris-website-011CUe4J6nRennEzgjHvDnbf`**

---

### **Step 3: Configure Build Settings**

Netlify should auto-detect Next.js, but verify these settings:

```
Base directory: polaris
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: .next
```

**Environment Variables** (optional for now):
```
NODE_VERSION = 22
```

Click **"Deploy site"**

---

### **Step 4: Wait for Build**

- Build typically takes 2-4 minutes
- You'll see logs in real-time
- Status will change from "Building" to "Published"

Once complete, you'll get a URL like: `https://polaris-abc123.netlify.app`

---

### **Step 5: Test Your Site**

1. Click on the generated URL
2. Test all pages:
   - Homepage (with savings calculator)
   - How It Works
   - Markets
   - About
   - Investors
   - Contact form
3. Test mobile responsiveness
4. Test navigation and all links

---

### **Step 6: Configure Custom Domain** (Optional)

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **"Domain management"**

2. Click **"Add custom domain"**

3. Enter: `polaris.estate`

4. Netlify will provide DNS configuration:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 75.2.60.5

   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: your-site-name.netlify.app
   ```

5. Update your domain's DNS settings with your registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

6. Wait for DNS propagation (5 minutes - 48 hours, usually ~1 hour)

7. SSL certificate will be automatically provisioned by Netlify (free)

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Build Fails**

If the build fails, check:

1. **Base directory is correct**: Should be `polaris` not root
2. **Node version**: Should be 22 or higher
3. **Build logs**: Look for specific error messages

**Common fixes:**
```bash
# If build fails, try adding this to Environment Variables:
NODE_VERSION = 22
```

### **Images Not Loading**

Unsplash images should load fine. If issues occur:
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify image URLs in components
- Try clearing Netlify cache (Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Clear cache)

### **404 on Page Refresh**

This shouldn't happen with our `netlify.toml` configuration, but if it does:
- Verify `netlify.toml` is in the root of the `polaris` directory
- Check redirect rules are present

---

## üìä Post-Deployment

### **1. Performance Check**

Run Lighthouse audit:
1. Open site in Chrome
2. Right-click ‚Üí Inspect
3. Go to "Lighthouse" tab

5. **Target scores: 95+ on all metrics**

### **2. Set Up Analytics** (Optional)

2. Get your Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. In Netlify dashboard: Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
4. Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID = G-XXXXXXXXXX`
5. Redeploy site

### **3. Enable Form Submissions** (Future)

For contact form to actually send emails:
1. Sign up for [Resend](https://resend.com) or [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
